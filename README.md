# Telco_Customer_Churn_with_Python
Analysis of IBM Watson Analytic customer telecommunications data to determine why customers are churning and develop a model to identify and predict at-risk customers.

This Python 3.6 code was developed for an analytics course and it is shared here in the hope that it may assist others on their analytic and Python learning journey. I inserted comments to assist with understanding my thought process. Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback.

The course featured these very broad objectives:
1) Successfully scrape the customer data from the internet.
2) Review and clean the data.
3) Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
4) Apply a descriptive analysis method to explain the relationship between independent variables.
5) Apply a predictive analysis method to model the relationship between the dependent variable and the most critical independent variables.
6) Summarize findings of why customers are churning.
7) Use the model to identify current customers most likely to churn.
